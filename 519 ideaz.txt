task 1: predict outcome of a match (teams)
- logistic regression
- naive bayes (must turn continuous into discrete bins)
- neural networks
- random forest
- svm
- very simple model: just go by team hltv rating or player ratings right before match
for each, optimize hyperparameters with cross-validation

features (calculate difference in each of these metrics as the input features);
maybe only consider past 3 months
- online vs lan
- if lan, then homefield or not
- winrate on the chosen map
// - average of all player ratings
- average number of rounds won in past 3 months
- average of player ADRs
- average of player KAST
- average of player +/-
- percent wins in the past month

- rWs
- percentage of pistol rounds won
- percentage of entry frags

task 2: predict individual player performance
features: (# frags), pm, adr, kast
